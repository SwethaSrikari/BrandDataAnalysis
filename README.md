# Analyzing Brand Data for Subscription Success

This project is all about looking at information about different brands that signed up on a website within a specific time period. The goal is to 

1. Find out trends and common behaviors in this information.
2. Understand what makes some brands successful, especially when it comes to choosing a subscription.
3. Figure out why some brands don't choose to upgrade to a paid subscription.

To make the information easier to understand, Tableau visualizations have been used. The data available is limited and to understand the trends even better, a few suggestions have been made.

This project is like a useful guide to understanding how different brands behave and make choices about subscriptions on the website.

The [report](https://github.com/SwethaSrikari/AnalyticsChallenge/blob/main/Report.pdf) delves into a dataset containing records of brands that registered on a platform during a specific timeframe. The report aims to uncover trends and patterns within this data, shedding light on factors contributing to customer success, particularly in terms of subscription adoption. Additionally, it identifies potential barriers preventing brands from upgrading to a paid subscription. 

The analysis is supported by visualizations, providing a clear representation of the findings. The report also addresses the limitations of the dataset and suggests additional data points that could enhance the study. It employs querying and coding languages to perform the analysis, and the associated code file is provided for reference. This report serves as a valuable resource for understanding brand behavior and subscription adoption on the platform.
